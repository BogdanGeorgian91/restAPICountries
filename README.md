This was another challenge from frontendmentor.io. It was very challenging and lots of fun to code. It was the first project where I used fetch API and created a color theme switcher functionality with a cool animation that takes into account the user's preference. Also, I think the search functionality is quite cool.

I also used new technologies I haven't used before, namely Vite and PostCSS. It was really fun to figure out how to implement them. I really liked the project.

Here's a video with the user flow on the site.
