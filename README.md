# restAPICountries

This was another challenge from frontendmentor.io. It was very challenging and lots of fun to code. It was the first project where I used fetch API.

I also used new technologies I haven't used before, namely Vite and PostCSS. It was really fun to figure it out how to implement them. I really liked the project.
